# 🛤️ C Programming Roadmap: From Beginner to Beast Mode (2025 - 2030 Ready)

## 🔰 Phase 0: Prep Before Programming
- Learn **Number Systems** (Binary, Octal, Decimal, Hex)
- Understand **ASCII Table**
- Basic Math & Logic Building
- Get a good **C compiler**: GCC or Turbo C

## 📘 Phase 1: Beginner – The Core of C
> Understand how C works and how to write clean, readable code.

### Topics:
- What is C Programming? History & Use-Cases
- Structure of a C Program
- Keywords, Identifiers, Tokens
- Variables and Data Types
- Operators (Arithmetic, Logical, Bitwise)
- Input/Output Functions (`printf()`, `scanf()`, `getchar()`, etc.)
- Control Structures:
  - `if`, `else`
  - `switch`
  - `for`, `while`, `do...while`
  - `break`, `continue`, `goto`
- Basic Programs (calculator, pattern printing, etc.)

---

## 🧠 Phase 2: Intermediate – Going Deeper
> Write real-world solving programs and understand memory behavior.

### Topics:
- Functions & Prototypes
  - Parameter Passing (Call by Value)
  - Return types, Recursion
- Storage Classes (`auto`, `register`, `static`, `extern`)
- Arrays: 1D, 2D, Multi-dimensional
- String Handling (`strcpy`, `strcmp`, etc.)
- Pointers: Basics, Arithmetic, Pointers to Pointers
- Structures & Unions
- Enumerations (`enum`)
- `typedef` and `#define`

### Practice:
- 100+ C Programs (e.g., reverse string, matrix operations)

---

## 🧩 Phase 3: Advanced – System-Level Skills
> Write low-level code and interact with files, memory, and OS.

### Topics:
- File Handling: `fopen()`, `fread()`, `fprintf()`, `fscanf()`
- Memory Management:
  - `malloc()`, `calloc()`, `realloc()`, `free()`
  - Detect and fix memory leaks
- Bitwise Operations
- Macros & Preprocessors
- Command-Line Arguments
- Function Pointers & Callbacks
- Header Files & Modular Programming
- Static vs Dynamic Linking

### Extra:
- Rebuild Standard Functions: `memcpy()`, `strlen()`, etc.
- Fun Challenges: Print without semicolon, without `main()`
- Time Functions: `clock()`, `time()`

---

## 🔥 Phase 4: Pro-Level & Real-World Stuff
> System-level software, CLI tools, even drivers.

### Topics:
- Linked Lists (Singly, Doubly, Circular)
- Stacks, Queues (Array & Linked List)
- Trees (Binary, BST)
- File Systems
- Shell Implementation
- OS Concepts: `fork()`, `exec()`, `pipe()`
- Multithreading with `pthread_create`, `pthread_join`

### Projects:
- File Compressor
- Text Editor (like Notepad)
- CLI Calculator
- Mini-SQL Engine (using files)

---

## 🧠 Phase 5: Competitive & Puzzle Programming
> Push your logic and skills to max level.

### Challenges:
- Print 1 to N without loop
- Swap without temp or operator
- Detect memory leaks
- Implement `printf()` and `scanf()`

### Sites:
- [HackerRank](https://www.hackerrank.com/)
- [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/)
- [SPOJ](https://www.spoj.com/)
- [GeeksforGeeks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/)

---

## 🧪 Phase 6: Testing Your C Brain
> Time to get surgical with your knowledge.

### Advanced Concepts:
- Undefined Behavior
- Deep Pointer Concepts
- Compilation & Linking
- Endianness
- `volatile`, `const`, `restrict` keywords

---

## 🚀 Phase 7: C Powers Everything
> Understand how C rules the core tech world.

### Topics:
- Learn how Linux Kernel is built in C
- Explore Open Source Projects:
  - [SQLite](https://www.sqlite.org/)
  - [Redis](https://redis.io/)
  - [Git](https://git-scm.com/)
- Try writing a basic OS kernel (DIYOS project)

---

## ✅ Tips for Success
- 💡 Code it out — no copy-paste.
- 📒 Take handwritten notes — old school rules.
- 🔁 Practice weekly logic puzzles.
- 🤝 Push code to GitHub to build your portfolio.
- 🧠 Optionally pair with Assembly for total mastery.
