## 💻 DBMS Lab: SQL Practice Based on Schema

### 🗃️ Schema:
**Employee** (Eno, Ename, Job_type, Manager, Hire_date, Dno, Commission, Salary)  
**Department** (Dno, Dname, Location)

### 🔎 30+ SQL Queries to Practice:
1. Display Employee Name, Job, Hire Date, Emp No (Emp No first).
2. Display all Employee data; separate each column by a comma.
3. Name and Salary of employees earning > $2850.
4. Name and Dno of Employee No = 7900.
5. Employees not earning between $1500–$2850.
6. Names & Dno of Dept 10 & 30 (Alphabetical).
7. Name & Hire Date of those hired in 1981.
8. Name & Job with no Manager.
9. Name, Salary, Commission where Commission exists.
10. Sort by descending Salary & Commission.
11. Names with 3rd letter 'A'.
12. Two 'A' or 'R' and Dept 30 or Manager = 7788.
13. Commission > 5% of Salary.
14. Show Current Date.
15. Review Date = 1st Monday after 6 months.
16. Months since hire date.
17. Display: "<Name> earns <Salary> but wants <3xSalary>".
18. Names starting with J, A, M in proper case + length.
19. Day of week of Hire Date.
20. Name, Dname, and Dno of all employees.
21. Unique Jobs in Dept 30.
22. Names with 'A' + Dept Name.
23. Name, Job, Dno, Dname for Dallas employees.
24. Name, Emp No, Manager Name, Manager No.
25. Emp with same Dno and Salary as those with Commission.
26. Show Highest, Lowest, Sum, Avg Salary.
27. Count of employees per Job type.
28. Dept Name, Location, No. of Emp, Avg Salary.
29. Name & Hire Date in Blake’s Dept.
30. Emp No & Name of those earning more than Avg Salary.
